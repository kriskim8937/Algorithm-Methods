## Algorithm-Methods

# Qustions to solve Problem
- You have to understand principle of Algorithm to solve advanced problem
- Did I solve similar problem before?
- Can I make it this problem simple?
- Can I make arithmatic expression to solve this problem?
- Can I drow a picture to solve this problem?
- Can I divide a problem to solve?
- Can I change the sequence to solve this problem?
- Can I compel the sequence to solve this problem?
- Can I normalize the problem to solve?
# How to write Good code
- Write simple, clean code 
- Reuse the code 
- Study standard library
- Use the same pattern to implement same algorithm(data structure)
- Follow the naming convention
- Normalize all the data before save it
- Separate the code and data
# Common Mistakes
- Arithmatic overflow
- Access to array out of range
- Use different range expression
- Off by one error
- static value typo
- stack over flow
- confuse index on multi dimension array
- incorrect compare function
- misuse Max Min exception
- False Operator Precedence
- Use slow input, output
- Variable initialize
