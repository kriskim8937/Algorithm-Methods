| Tables        | Tabulation/ Bottom Up    | Memoization/ Top Down |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| state      | State Transition relation is diffult to think | State transition relation is easy to think |
| code      | Code gets complicated when lot of conditions are required      |   Code is easy and less complicated |
| speed | Fast, as we directly access previous states from the table      |   Slow due to lot of recursive calls and return statement |
| Subproblem Solving | If all subproblems must be solved at least once, BUDP usually outperforms a TDDP by a constant factor  | If some sub problems need not be solved at all, TDDP has the advantage of solving only subprobelm that are required |
| Table Entries | Starting from the entry, all filled one by one | The table is filled on demand |
