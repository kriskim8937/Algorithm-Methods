## BFS

## Summary

The major difference between BFS and DFS is that BFS proceeds level by level while DFS follows first a path form the starting to the ending node (vertex), then another path from the start to end, and so on until all nodes are visited. Furthermore, BFS uses the queue for storing the nodes whereas DFS uses the stack for traversal of the nodes.

## Where to use? (Application)
If there is no cost(on the node) it is optimal way to find a shortest route.
