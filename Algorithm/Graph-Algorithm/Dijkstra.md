> Bellman-Ford algorithm is a single-source shortest path algorithm, so when you have negative edge weight then it can detect negative cycles in a graph.
> The only difference between two is that Bellman Ford is capable also to handle negative weights whereas Dijkstra Algorithm can only handle positives.
