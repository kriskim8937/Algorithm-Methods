## Shortest path problem
  - Single-source shortest paths
    - Dijkstra / "more efficient" than the Bellman-Ford algorithm
    - Bellamn - Ford / capable also to handle negative weights
  - All-pairs shortest paths
    - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
    - Johnson's algorithm
  - Single-Pair " / 
  - Single-destination "/
